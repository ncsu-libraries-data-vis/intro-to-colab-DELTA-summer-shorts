    "Computational notebooks are a type of literate programming document, where you write and evaluate code, view your data and plots, and write explanations and full text all in one document. While there are many forms of computational notebooks, one of the most common today is the Jupyter notebook, which we see particularly often in data science. Jupyter started in the Python ecosystem, but can now support interactive programming in many different languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computational notebooks are a great learning tool, since they allow you to see immediate output and easily document the code you are writing. They are often used to prototype code, where you might need to repeatedly adjust and re-run chunks of code as part of an analysis. You can then export the code into a standard script file, such as a `.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colaboratory is a free-to-use, hosted version of Jupyter. It allows you to create notebooks and run them using Google's servers and processing power, and even offers free access to GPUs. Notebooks are stored in your Google Drive, can be shared with others, and exported to the standard open-source `ipynb` format used by Jupyter or to normal Python files. There are limitations to the memory allocated to each notebook, and to how long notebooks can run, but Google provides a remarkable amount of resources for no financial cost. "
